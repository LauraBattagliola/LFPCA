\title{Cosine Window Function}
\usage{
window_cos(block_indices, num_timepoints, delta = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{block_indices}{Integer vector of time indices belonging to the block.}

\item{num_timepoints}{Total number of time points in the data.}

\item{delta}{Numeric value controlling the width of the transition region.
Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \code{num_timepoints} containing the
window function values.
}
\description{
Computes a smooth window function using cosine tapering for transitioning
between blocks. The function is 1 within the block and smoothly transitions
to 0 outside using a cosine taper.
}
\details{
For each contiguous segment within \code{block_indices}, the function creates
a window that:
\itemize{
\item Transitions from 0 to 1 over \code{[a - delta, a]} using a cosine taper
\item Equals 1 over the interior \code{(a, b)}

\item Transitions from 1 to 0 over \code{[b, b + delta]} using a cosine taper
}
where \code{a} and \code{b} are the start and end of each contiguous segment.
}
\examples{
# Create a window for indices 10-20 out of 50 timepoints
w <- window_cos(15:20, num_timepoints = 50, delta = 0.2)
plot(w, type = "l", main = "Cosine Window Function")
}
