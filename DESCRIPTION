Description: Performs Localized Functional Principal Component Analysis (LFPCA) 
    by detecting block-diagonal structure in the empirical covariance function of a functional sample using singular value decomposition, then computing principal components within each 
    localized block. This approach allows for more interpretable eigenfunctions 
    that capture local features of the data. The package provides smooth 
    tapering via cosine or Epanechnikov window functions to ensure smooth 
    transitions between blocks.
